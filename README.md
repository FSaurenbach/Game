- A bunch of programs in one project and some of them are not mine, 
note that my art tool requires that palettes be less than 65 pixels
in width and 1 pixel in y. The max resolution it takes is 64x1, meaning
64 colors. Find a palette here: https://lospec.com/palette-list, open your
image editor and edit it a bit and then start playing.
